# SparkFun MAX1704x Fuel Gauge Arduino Library

The MAX17043/MAX17044 are ultra-compact, low-cost,
host-side fuel-gauge systems for lithium-ion (Li+) batteries
in handheld and portable equipment. The MAX17043
is configured to operate with a single lithium cell and the
MAX17044 is configured for a dual-cell 2S pack.

This Arduino library provides support for both devices.
